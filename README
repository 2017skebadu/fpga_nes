fpga_nes is an fpga-targeted Nintento Entertainment System emulator written in Verilog.  It is
currently under development, and is missing support for mappers and sound as well as some
other smaller features.  At this point, it is able to run most NROM games well without sound
(e.g., Super Mario Brothers, Excitebike).

In addition, this project includes a C++ Windows application called NesDbg, which communicates
with the FPGA over USB UART to load ROMs, run unit tests, read/write memory, etc.

Unfortunetly, getting up and running with the project is fairly complicated and expensive.
